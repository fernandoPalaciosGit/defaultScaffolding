# Grunt Tasks cheatsheet generator
## This is a Grunt tasks cheatsheet generator. It means you'll be able to add, edit and remove your grunt tasks / commands, and export a cheatsheet of them.
## The fact is that this is a first custom backbone.js app, and I thought this is a good idea for learning.

###### Steps for deploying
1. **npm install**
2. **grunt** (see Gruntfile.js for seeing avaliable tasks)
3. **bower install**
